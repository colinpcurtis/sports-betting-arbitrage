# Sports Betting Arbitrage

Sports betting arbitrage involves taking offsetting positions in different bookmakers with a total cost less than the payout, ensuring risk-free profit.

This uses [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/) to get the odds from various bookmakers for sporting events to find these opportunities.

## Usage
You must have an API Key from The Odds API, and set the environment variable `THE_ODDS_API_KEY`.

Then you can run the file `arb.py` to write the arbitrage opportunities to a file.
